Hey tech enthusiasts! üë®‚ÄçüíªüöÄ Today, we're venturing into the mystical realm of Privileged Identity Management (PIM) iteration 3 APIs. Ever felt like deciphering PIM APIs is like unraveling ancient runes? Join the club! Today's quest involves the nuances of activating roles for groups eligible under PIM...

1. **Privileged Identity Management APIs Overview**: [This article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-apis#iteration-3-current--pim-for-microsoft-entra-roles-groups-in-microsoft-graph-api-and-for-azure-resources-in-arm-api) on Microsoft Learn provides a overview of PIM APIs. It is unfortunatly not great and I hope that this article does a better job at getting you started.

> For those who prefer to run the script without delving into the blog, the full script is available [here](https://github.com/Dikkekip/dikkekip.github.io/blob/main/scripts/2024-01-24-pim-for-groups-1/Enable-GroupsforPim.ps1).

1. **Why Use PIM for Groups?**: Let's decode the "why" behind the wizardry of PIM for Groups. Imagine you're the guardian of a mystical realm (your organization's IT environment). In this realm, power (access rights) must be bestowed carefully. PIM for Groups is like having a magical keyring that gives you control over who holds these powers and for how long.

   - **Just-In-Time Access**: Think of it as a time-locked vault. You can grant access to certain resources, but only for a specific duration. This way, users have the privileges they need, exactly when they need them, reducing the risk of 'power' lingering in the wrong hands.

   - **Role-Based Assignments**: It's like assigning roles in a play. Each actor (user) gets a part (role) that's essential for the scene (task) but only for the duration of their performance (specific time or project). This ensures that users don't retain privileges beyond their current needs.

   - **Minimize Security Risks**: By controlling access more granularly, you're essentially setting up magical wards against security breaches. No more permanent, unchecked access means less chance of your defenses being breached by dark forces (unauthorized users).

   - **Streamline Management**: Managing a large group of wizards (users) can be chaotic. PIM for Groups brings order to this chaos by automating the process of assigning and revoking access. It's like having an administrative crystal ball, giving you a clear view of who has access to what and when.

   - **Compliance and Auditing**: In the world of IT, you must often answer to higher powers (compliance regulations). PIM for Groups helps you maintain a detailed log of who accessed what and when, which is like keeping a detailed spell book for auditing purposes.

In essence, PIM for Groups empowers you to manage your realm with precision and agility, ensuring that the right powers are in the right hands at the right time. It's not just about keeping your kingdom safe; it's about ruling it wisely. üöÄüîÆ

3. **Scripting with PowerShell & GraphAPI**: Time to get our hands dirty with some PowerShell scripting and GraphAPI sorcery! We'll automate the assignment of eligible members to groups using these tools, weaving our code as cleanly as a well-crafted spell.

4. **Step-by-Step Guide**: Prepare your wizard's robe and wand (or just a comfy chair and your computer), as we embark on a magical journey through the world of PIM for Groups automation. Here's your detailed map through the mystical forest of Azure and PowerShell scripting:

üìö A Wizard's Guide to Azure Group Enchantment via PowerShell
Congratulations, brave wizard of the cloud! You're about to embark on a mystical quest to manage Azure groups with PowerShell and Privileged Identity Management (PIM). This arcane journey involves tapping into the power of Graph API, even as we await its latest incantations for group management. Let's start conjuring!

ü™Ñ The Spell Preparation: Importing Essential Modules
Before casting our spells, we need to prepare our magical ingredients. In the wizarding world of PowerShell, this means ensuring the necessary modules are installed and ready for use.


```powershell
# Ensuring the presence of the Microsoft.Graph module
if (-not (Get-Module -Name Microsoft.Graph -ListAvailable)) {
    Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser -Force
    Write-Host "üîÆ Microsoft.Graph module installed successfully!" -ForegroundColor Cyan
}
else {
    Write-Host "‚úÖ Microsoft.Graph module is already installed." -ForegroundColor Green
}

# Ensuring the presence of the Az.Accounts module
if (-not (Get-Module -Name Az.Accounts -ListAvailable)) {
    Install-Module -Name Az.Accounts -Scope CurrentUser -Force
    Write-Host "üîÆ Az.Accounts module installed successfully!" -ForegroundColor Cyan
}
else {
    Write-Host "‚úÖ Az.Accounts module is already installed." -ForegroundColor Green
}

# Ensuring the presence of the Az.Accounts module
if (-not (Get-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleGuiTools -ListAvailable)) {
    Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleGuiTools -Scope CurrentUser -Force
    Write-Host "üîÆ Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleGuiTools module installed successfully!" -ForegroundColor Cyan
}
else {
    Write-Host "‚úÖ Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleGuiTools module is already installed." -ForegroundColor Green
}


```
üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Wizard's Tip:
Always check for the existence of a module before trying to install it. This prevents unnecessary incantations and keeps your magic (and scripts) efficient!

üåå Navigating the Azure Cosmos: Next Steps
With our modules at the ready, we are prepared to dive deeper into the Azure cosmos. Our next steps will involve authenticating with Azure, conjuring groups, and binding them with the power of PIM. Each step, akin to a magical incantation, must be executed with precision and understanding.


#### 2. üåü Advanced Wizardry: Unveiling the Secrets of Microsoft Graph Connection
Great! You're progressing splendidly on your mystical quest through the Azure cosmos. Now, it's time to establish a connection with the Microsoft Graph ‚Äî akin to tapping into the very lifeblood of Azure's intelligence network. Here's how you'll weave this intricate part of the spell.

üåÄ Connecting to the Oracle of Graph
The Microsoft Graph is like the Oracle of Delphi for Azure wizards. By establishing a connection, we gain insights and control over the Azure realm's inner workings.


```powershell

# Import the Microsoft.Graph.Identity.Governance module
Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Identity.Governance

# Establishing a connection to Microsoft Graph
# Think of this as tuning your crystal ball to the right magical frequency
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Group.ReadWrite.All", "User.Read.All", "PrivilegedAccess.ReadWrite.AzureADGroup"

# Summoning all groups from the depths of Azure
# Like casting a net into the sea of the cloud to see what mysteries we can uncover
Get-MgGroup

```

üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Wizard's Insight:
Choosing the correct scopes is crucial! It's like picking the right herbs for a potion. Here, we're using Group.ReadWrite.All, User.Read.All, and PrivilegedAccess.ReadWrite.AzureADGroup to ensure we have the necessary permissions for our operations.

üîÆ What Lies Ahead
Now that we're connected and have summoned our groups, we're ready to delve into more complex rituals. We'll be exploring how to filter these groups, apply PIM policies, and much more. Each step is a rune in the grand spell we're casting to master Azure Group management.

Stay vigilant, brave wizard! The path of a cloud sorcerer is fraught with complexities, but fear not, for you have the might of PowerShell and the wisdom of the Microsoft Graph on your side! üå©Ô∏èüîÆ


#### 3. ü™Ñ The Art of Group Conjuration in Azure: A Wizard's Guide
Ah, the noble art of creating Azure groups using PowerShell! This step is akin to shaping the very fabric of our cloud kingdom. Let's weave this part of our grand spell with care and precision.

ü™Ñ The Incantation for Group Creation
Now, we shall embark on the mystical process of group creation. Remember, naming conventions in the realm of Azure are more than mere words; they are the identifiers of your dominion's structure and purpose.

Naming standards may vary But I use the following format:
{prefix}-{system}-{type}-{region}-{LzName}-{role}

For this demo, I will create the following 2 groups:
- `d-avd-sec-weu-sandbox-lz-dikkekip-AdminAccess`
- `d-demo-sec-weu-sandbox-lz-dikkekip-AdminAccess`

With this part of the script, we will create the groups and add the user we create the groups with as owner so that we can manage Pim for groups.

        $GroupBody = @{
            DisplayName         = $entry.name
            Description         = $entry.description
            MailEnabled         = $false
            MailNickname        = $entry.name
            SecurityEnabled     = $true

        }
        $newGroup = New-MgGroup -BodyParameter $GroupBody
        Write-Host "‚ú® Group $($entry.name) has been successfully conjured!" -ForegroundColor Green
        $groupsCreated += $newGroup

foreach ($group in $groupsCreated) {
    Write-Host "üìú Group Name: $($group.DisplayName), ID: $($group.Id)" -ForegroundColor Green
}
```

üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Voil√†, esteemed cloud wizard! With mere lines of PowerShell incantation, you've called groups into being within our vast Azure kingdom. Remember, wielding the wand of scripting comes with considerable responsibility ‚Äî but let's not forget the sprinkles of joy and intrigue it brings!

üîë Why anoint ourselves as the group's sovereign? In the Entra ID realm, owning a group transcends mere titular honor. It bestows upon you the master key to this digital dominion. As the owner, you're empowered to designate users as eligible members, akin to granting access to the inner sanctums of your castle. Without this key, the ability to effectively govern the denizens (users) of your Entra ID territory remains an elusive dream.

#### 4. üåê Activating PIM's Mystical Shield for Groups

The next crucial incantation in our spellbook involves invoking Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for our newly spawned or chosen groups. This potent sorcery bestows upon you the capability to manage group memberships with the wisdom of just-in-time access and eligibility criteria. It's like weaving a protective enchantment around your groups, ensuring that only those with the right credentials and timing can enter your Azure fortress. Embrace this power wisely, for it's a cornerstone in the architecture of secure and efficient Azure management.

üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Wizard's Insight:
Enabling PIM for groups is not just about control; it's about smart control. It allows you to manage who has access, when they have it, and under what conditions. This is crucial in maintaining the sanctity and security of your Azure ecosystem. With great power comes the need for equally great foresight and discretion. üååüîÆüõ°Ô∏è

#### ‚ö° The Time-Honored Spell: Onboarding Groups to PIM

In the ever-evolving world of Azure, sometimes we must rely on the wisdom of the ancients. For onboarding groups into Privileged Identity Management (PIM), the new CMDLets are like elusive unicorns, yet to be discovered in our forests. So, we turn to the classic methods, as detailed in the [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/groups-discover-groups). It's akin to using an old, trusted map when the new GPS hasn't been updated for the latest roads.

#### üìö A Note on Documentation

In the realm of Azure PIM automation with PowerShell, documentation plays the role of a magical grimoire, guiding fellow wizards through the labyrinth of cloud identity management. Here's a condensed essence of our journey and some pointers to keep in mind:

1. **API Limitations and Workarounds**: As we delved into the task, it was clear that the Graph API currently doesn't support certain operations directly. We resorted to using the older Privileged Identity Management iteration 2 API, a path less trodden but well-documented [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/privilegedidentitymanagement-root?view=graph-rest-beta). It's crucial to keep abreast of updates, as Microsoft's wizards are known for enhancing their APIs with new capabilities over time.

2. **Onboarding Groups and Users**: The core of our script involved onboarding groups to PIM and then adding users as eligible members.
