## Maarten Rosier - Cloud & DevOps Architect

Hello and welcome to my blog, Adventures in Cloud and Code. My name is Maarten Rosier and I'm a Cloud & DevOps Architect with a passion for exploring the latest developments in Azure, Bicep, Infrastructure as Code, Entra ID, Intune, and Azure Virtual Desktop. I was born and raised in the beautiful coastal town of The Hague in the Netherlands. now embracing the frosty beauty of Norway. I’ve swapped our famous Dutch canals for fjords, all in pursuit of groundbreaking cloud migration projects and a closer connection with nature. I focus on Microsoft products and work in Oslo for Devoteam M Cloud.

I started this blog to share my insights and experiences with fellow tech enthusiasts and anyone curious about the world of cloud and code. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, I hope you'll find something here to pique your interest and expand your knowledge.

Expect this blog to be a tech-savvy brain dump, full of PowerShell, AI-generated texts, and code. I love to seek out the latest technologies and preview features, using them in the field. I hope this will initiate discussions and hopefully create better and more creative solutions and automation processes for real-life challenges. Please fork/contribute to or challenge the scripts and articles shared here. Any collaboration is welcome

I dove into the IT world in 2012 at the age of 18. While my peers were enjoying their student life, I was busy getting my hands dirty with the latest in tech. Self-taught and driven, It has been a great honor to work with so many different companies and challenges. Therefore, I have a wide range of experience at various levels. The IT landscape always changes rapidly, and we should always be curious to learn, explore, and challenge ourselves. I have been given the chance to work with the latest tech and budgets that companies have to offer.

So, thank you for dropping by. Dive in, explore, and let’s embark on this incredible tech adventure together. I'm excited to see where our discussions and collaborations will take us.
